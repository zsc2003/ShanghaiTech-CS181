In this project, we implement several draught game agents using the technique learned in the CS181 course. We also design an evaluation function for the draught game and evaluate its strength in each agent. By bridging theory and implementation, the project enhances problem-solving skills and demonstrates the real-world relevance of AI concepts. It serves as an interdisciplinary example of AI's applicability, illustrating how AI techniques can be employed in gaming and beyond.
