# Project Requirement

## Topic

Use what you have learned in this course to solve a problem of your choice.

In order to help you decide your project topic, here we release [F22 slides](https://elearning.shanghaitech.edu.cn:8443/bbcswebdav/pid-106415-dt-content-rid-9729526_1/xid-9729526_1)

of the remaining topics to be covered in this course:



- Probabilistic temporal models
- Markov decision processes
- Reinforcement learning
- Machine learning

## Group

There should be 1-5 people in each group. You are encouraged to form large groups.

To find a group to join or recruit more members for your group, you may use the Piazza “search for teammates” function.



## Timetable

- By late December: form your group
- Early January 2024.: proposal presentation
- Jan. 25&26 (week 18): final presentation, report submission



## Grading

15% of the total grade. Your project will be judged by its substance, soundness, its relevance to this course, and the quality of your report and presentation.



## Usage of external code and tools

While we do not prohibit usage of external code and tools in your project, please note that:

1) the core component and algorithms of your project should be implemented by yourself, and

2) in your final presentation and report, you must explicitly list all the external resources that you use and explain how/why you use them.

After the final presentation, you will be asked to submit your source code along with your final project report, so we could manually check whether you follow the above policy.
